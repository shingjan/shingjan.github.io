I'm currently at [OctoML](https://octoml.ai) where I work as a senior software engineer in the MLSys team on inference, optimizations and hardware acceleration for machine learning models. I also contribute to Apache TVM & PyTorch on stuff like model compilation, coverage and auto-tuning.

I was a software engineer at [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com) working on [Data Lake](https://www.snowflake.com/data-lake/) and semi/un-structured data storage, like parquet and delta lake. I also interned at [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.msra.cn/), working on transactional distributed databases.

I earned my master's degree from [UIUC CS](https://cs.illinois.edu/) and bachelor's degree from [PolyU](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/). I worked with [Prof. Vikram Adve](https://vikram.cs.illinois.edu) on compilation of Deep Learning models with [HPVM](https://publish.illinois.edu/hpvm-project/)/[LLVM](https://llvm.org) during my master's thesis and [Prof. Zili Shao](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~shao/) on key-value store.
